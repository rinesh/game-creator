# game-creator

**Go from game idea to deployed, monetized browser game in minutes — not hours.**

Tell your AI coding agent "make a space invaders game" and get a fully playable browser game. The Phaser 2D and Three.js 3D template pipeline adds pixel art, procedural audio, automated QA, deployment, and [Play.fun](https://play.fun) monetization. For KAPLAY, create and iterate directly in the active [Kaplayground](https://github.com/rinesh/kaplayground) page through its browser-native WebMCP tools.

Works with **40+ AI coding agents** — Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, and more via `npx skills add`.

**Owner**: [OpusGameLabs](https://github.com/OpusGameLabs)

## Install

```bash
npx skills add OpusGameLabs/game-creator
```

Target a specific agent:

```bash
npx skills add OpusGameLabs/game-creator -a claude-code
npx skills add OpusGameLabs/game-creator -a cursor
npx skills add OpusGameLabs/game-creator -a codex
npx skills add OpusGameLabs/game-creator -a antigravity
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build a complete 2D game (scaffold → pixel art → design → audio → deploy → monetize)
# QA subagent runs after every step (build, runtime, gameplay, architecture, visual)
/game-creator:make-game 2d my-game

# Build from a tweet
/game-creator:make-game https://x.com/user/status/123456

# Open Kaplayground in a WebMCP-capable agent browser, then build or edit its current project
/game-creator:kaplay "make a coin collector"

# Or run individual steps on an existing game:
/game-creator:add-assets          # Replace shapes with pixel art sprites
/game-creator:design-game         # Add visual polish (particles, juice, transitions)
/game-creator:add-audio           # Add chiptune music and sound effects
/game-creator:add-feature jetpack # Add a gameplay feature
/game-creator:improve-game        # Audit + implement highest-impact improvements
/game-creator:monetize-game       # Register on Play.fun, add SDK, get monetized URL
/game-creator:review-game         # Code review for architecture + best practices
/game-creator:qa-game             # Add Playwright QA tests
```

## How It Works

`/make-game` is the Phaser/Three.js orchestrator. It delegates all code writing to subagents and runs a QA subagent after every code-modifying step:

```
Step 0  Parse args, create task list                           ← main thread
Step 1  Scaffold game from template                            ← code subagent → QA subagent
Step 1.5 Add pixel art sprites (2D only)                       ← code subagent → QA subagent
Step 2  Visual polish (particles, juice, transitions)          ← code subagent → QA subagent
Step 3  Audio (Strudel.cc BGM + SFX)                           ← code subagent → QA subagent
Step 4  Deploy to here.now                                     ← main thread (instant publish)
Step 5  Monetize with Play.fun                                 ← main thread (interactive auth)
```

The QA subagent runs 5 phases per step: build check, runtime check (headless Chromium), gameplay verification (iterate client with game-specific actions), architecture validation, and visual review (Playwright MCP screenshots). If any phase fails, an autofix subagent patches the code and QA re-runs (up to 3 attempts per step).

`/kaplay` uses the project already open in the WebMCP-enabled Kaplayground page. It reads and replaces editor files through page-defined tools, runs the preview, checks diagnostics and console output, and uses the browser for screenshots plus gameplay input when the preview iframe is controllable. It does not copy a Phaser template or invent a second local project; the active page supplies the KAPLAY tool surface without a separate tool-server setup.

## Architecture

Games created by the Phaser/Three.js template pipeline follow this architecture:

```
src/
├── core/
│   ├── EventBus.js       # Singleton pub/sub — all cross-module communication
│   ├── GameState.js      # Centralized state with reset() for clean restarts
│   ├── Constants.js      # Every magic number, color, timing, speed
│   └── GameConfig.js     # Engine config (Phaser or Three.js)
├── scenes/               # Scene lifecycle (Phaser) or states (Three.js)
├── entities/             # Game objects (player, enemies, obstacles)
├── systems/              # Background, particles, spawners
├── sprites/              # Pixel art data (palette, matrices, tiles)
├── audio/                # Strudel.cc procedural audio
│   ├── AudioManager.js   # Init, play, stop wrapper
│   ├── AudioBridge.js    # Wires EventBus → AudioManager
│   ├── music.js          # Background music patterns
│   └── sfx.js            # Sound effect patterns
├── playfun.js            # Play.fun SDK integration
└── main.js               # Entry point + render_game_to_text() + advanceTime()
```

**EventBus** — Modules never import each other. All communication via pub/sub with `domain:action` event names.

**GameState** — Single source of truth. `reset()` gives a clean slate for restarts.

**Constants** — Zero hardcoded values in game logic. Sizes are proportional (`GAME.WIDTH * ratio`), with DPR-aware scaling for retina displays.

**`render_game_to_text()`** — Every game exposes `window.render_game_to_text()` returning a JSON string of current game state, so AI agents can read the game without interpreting pixels.

## Examples

8 complete example games in `examples/`, demonstrating both engines:

| Game | Engine | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `flappy-bird` | Phaser 3 | Classic flappy clone — 5 scenes, 15 Playwright tests, full audio |
| `barn-defense` | Phaser 3 | Tower defense game |
| `vampire-survivors` | Phaser 3 | Survivors-like auto-attacking game |
| `example-game` | Phaser 3 | Asteroid dodger (generated by `/make-game` test run) |
| `flappy-bird-3d` | Three.js | 3D flappy bird variant |
| `flight-simulator` | Three.js | Flight sim with terrain |
| `labyrinth` | Three.js | 3D maze game |
| `singularity-run` | Three.js | Endless runner with matrix rain effects |

```bash
cd examples/flappy-bird
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:3000
npm run test       # Playwright tests
npm run build      # Production build to dist/
```

## Templates

`/make-game` copies a runnable starter project from `templates/` — not generated from scratch. Both templates include all dependencies, the full EventBus/GameState/Constants architecture, QA scripts, and procedural graphics (no asset files).

| Template | Engine | Includes |
|----------|--------|----------|
| `phaser-2d` | Phaser 3 | Boot/Game/GameOver scenes, Player entity, ScoreSystem, arcade physics, high-DPI support |
| `threejs-3d` | Three.js | Game orchestrator, Player mesh, LevelBuilder, HTML overlays, InputSystem (touch + keyboard) |

Both templates ship with `scripts/verify-runtime.mjs` (headless runtime check), `scripts/iterate-client.js` (action replay + screenshots), `scripts/validate-architecture.mjs` (pattern validator), and `scripts/example-actions.json` (default test actions).

KAPLAY work uses the editor-managed files in Kaplayground instead of a third template. The `kaplay` skill preserves Kaplayground's `main.js`, `kaplay.js`, `assets.js`, `scenes/`, `objects/`, and `utils/` layout, updates files with revision-aware page-defined WebMCP tools, and verifies the live preview in the same browser tab.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| 2D Engines | Phaser 3 (`^3.90.0`); KAPLAY (`3001.0.19` stable baseline, with the active Kaplayground version discovered at runtime) |
| 3D Engine | Three.js (`^0.183.0`) |
| Live editor API | [Kaplayground](https://github.com/rinesh/kaplayground) browser WebMCP, surfaced by the active page |
| Audio | Strudel.cc (`@strudel/web ^1.3.0`) — AGPL-3.0 |
| Build | Vite (`^7.3.1`) |
| Testing | Playwright (`^1.58.0`) + axe-core (`^4.11.0`) |
| Monetization | [Play.fun](https://play.fun) (OpenGameProtocol) |
| Language | JavaScript ES modules; Kaplayground also permits TypeScript supporting files |

## Quality Assurance

QA is built into every code-modifying step of the pipeline via a dedicated QA subagent:

1. **Build** — `npm run build` catches compilation errors
2. **Runtime** — Headless Chromium checks for WebGL errors, uncaught exceptions, console errors
3. **Gameplay** — Iterate client replays game-specific actions, verifies scoring works and death triggers
4. **Architecture** — Validates EventBus/GameState/Constants patterns, flags magic numbers
5. **Visual** — Playwright MCP screenshots check entity visibility, safe zone compliance, button labels

If any phase fails, an autofix subagent patches the code and QA re-runs (up to 3 attempts). Problems are caught when introduced, not at the end of the pipeline.

For KAPLAY, the equivalent gate is browser-backed: run the Kaplayground preview, require clean diagnostics, inspect fresh console entries, and use the same tab to review a screenshot. Exercise the requested gameplay when the browser can control the preview iframe, and otherwise state that behavioral verification remains incomplete.

## Play.fun Integration

The `/monetize-game` command (and Step 5 of `/make-game`) registers games on [Play.fun](https://play.fun) and integrates the browser SDK:

1. Authenticate via web callback or manual paste
2. Register game with anti-cheat limits based on scoring system
3. Add CDN script + `src/playfun.js` (wires EventBus to `addPoints()`/`savePoints()`)
4. Rebuild and redeploy

The SDK is non-blocking — if it fails to load, the game still works. Points buffer locally during gameplay and sync on game over.
