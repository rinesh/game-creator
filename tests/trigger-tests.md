# Skill Trigger Test Suite

Manual test prompts to verify skills trigger correctly. Run each prompt against the plugin and verify the expected skill loads (or doesn't load).

## How to Use

1. Install this fork: `npx skills add rinesh/game-creator`
2. For each test case, enter the prompt in your AI coding agent
3. Verify the correct skill loads (check the skill name in the agent's response)
4. Mark pass/fail
